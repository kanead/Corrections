I must admit I was ultra hesitant to amend, at least partly because of the stigma of making a mistake. But also because I suffer deeply from perfectionism. I am so careful with my scientific work that I get annoyed when people are sloppy and then expect me to do extra work to make up for their sloppiness. Actually, now that I think of it, I did once discover an error in a paper that I co-authored (as a co-supervisor of a student) but did not discover it until many years after it was published. I didn't pursue the amendment for all the reasons listed above (time, stigma, hassle) and also the long length of time which had passed since publication. ","Yes",""
