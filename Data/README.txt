##Survey was stopped after three weeks. Last entry was on the 27th of January 

##132 responses in total 

For analysis: 
There were two questions that had multiple options, namely: 

1) If the attempt for amendment was unsuccessful: Why? --> WhyUA.csv

2) If you haven't formalized an attempt for amendment: Why not? --> WhyNFA.csv


For both of these, since excel output has multiple answers in the same cell, a new file was created. The original response is under the column "FirstResponse". 
In these files, empty cells were removed. Cells that contained multiple answers were split up, so that each row has one input (see Example #1 below).

Individuals were allowed to bring up their own reasons, but these obviously were highly variable. Some answers were collated into one of the excisting categories (see Example #2). 
Answers that could not easily be collated into one of the existing categories (see Example #3), were instead collated into a new category called "Other". 
This redefining led to the new column, called "FinalResponse".  







EXAMPLE#1: 

A row that had "Time consuming; Editors/Journals not being cooperative", was split up into two rows. One with "Time consuming" and the other with "Editors/Journals not being cooperative". 

EXAMPLE #2: 

A row that had "no answer form the journal", which was an original input from a participant, was changed to "Editors/Journals not being cooperative". 

EXAMPLE #3: 
 
A row that had "Once I finish some more study If I find I made mistakes in past I will correct. So far, the status of knwoledge is more or less same.", was changed to "Other".
