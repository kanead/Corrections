The type of amendment I would like to do is an „update“ a few years after publication with more data to either support the previous findings or say that with more data the results were not reproducible. Such „updates“ are currently not possible or sought after in the scientific literature ,Other

"A senior author on a paper once suggested I amend an author list on a paper I led, but I pushed back because I didn't feel the person contributed sufficiently (they were asked several times to contribute and did not). I must admit I was ultra hesitant to amend, at least partly because of the stigma of making a mistake. But also because I suffer deeply from perfectionism. I am so careful with my scientific work that I get annoyed when people are sloppy and then expect me to do extra work to make up for their sloppiness. Actually, now that I think of it, I did once discover an error in a paper that I co-authored (as a co-supervisor of a student) but did not discover it until many years after it was published. I didn't pursue the amendment for all the reasons listed above (time, stigma, hassle) and also the long length of time which had passed since publication. ",Other
